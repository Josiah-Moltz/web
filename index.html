</h2>

<h4> Who am I? </h4>

My name is Josiah, I live in Queens NY, and I am on the Stuyvesant Math Team. I have other hobbies, but math is something I feel most confident in writing about. 

<h4> Why Math? </h4>

I think it is fun thinking about challenging problems, providing the why behind how something works, and I enjoy that topics build ontop of eachother until a simple idea has brought you to something very complex.

<h4> Other interests </h4>

Some other interests of mine are talking with friends, personal writing, and messing around with computer science. 

<h4> How was all this made? </h4>

The website was put together using html for my Annual IntroCS class with Mr. Mykolyk. Most of the handouts were put together using LaTeX a typesetting program. The diagrams were made with Asymptote the vector graphics language.

<h4> Contacting Me </h4>
I will likely be most responsive if you contact me through my school email: jmoltz30@stuy.edu
<br>
Other forms of contact include Facebook Messenger (Josiah Moltz) and Discord (Josiah Moltz#1057).

        <a name="dilation"><i>Dilation</i></a> <br>
        A dilation is a transformation which produces an image the same shape as the original, but of a different size. A dilation has 2 key components, the Center of Dilation, and the Scale Factor. The Center of Dilation tells us from where we are dilating, while the Scale Factor tells us how much to dilate. <br>
        More formally, a dilation centered at point O with scale factor k sends every point P to another point P' on ray OP so that OP'/OP=k.

        <a name="collinear"><i>Collinear</i></a> <br>
        Collinear just means to lie on the same line. For example 3 points are collinear if and only if the line connecting any 2 of them passes through the third.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4> Dilations </h4>

Some interesting geometry I have been working on has been from Euclidean Geometry in Math Olympiads by Evan Chen (free shortened version found <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/textbooks/tr011ey.pdf">here</a> full version found <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/geombook.html">here</a>). Currently I am working through Chapter 4, which is on specific configurations. Something really interesting in this chapter as been the concept of using <a href="#dilation"><i>dilations</i></a>. 
<br>
One reason I find dilations so intriguing is that they provide interesting ways of proving <a href="#collinear"><i>collinearity</i></a>, and calculating angle measures. For example lets say we want to show that points O, P, and Q are collinear. This could be done simply by showing that a dilation centered at O sends point P to point Q. Since dilations preserve collinearity with the center of dilation, this would suffice in showing that O, P, and Q lie on the same line. Another cool use for dilations is calculating ratios of segments, or angle measure, as both are preserved under dilation.
<br>
Overall I am drawn to dilations because they allow you to apply knowledge from a different part of the diagram directly to a new part, making seemingly irrelevant knowledge become front and center.
<br>
To see an interesting problem and handout utilizing dilations, check out <a href="#MC2016P240">Mathcounts Angles and Arcs problem 240</a>. 
<br>
To check out my own personal uses of dilations check out my notes on chapter 4 of EGMO <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oa7vbh6VBI3rhk5ZY9mpfZniUxEaKvHu/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. Note these are just my personal solutions, and are incomplete as well as I am still working on the chapter.
<br>
Other uses for dilations can be found in studying the ninepoint circle, and in the relationship between the incenters and excenters of a triangle. 


<h2> <!-- Section 2 -->
    <a name="section2"> Interesting Problems </a>
</h2>

<p> 
    These are a collection of problems I found to be very interesting. I will not be providing full solutions to all of them, becuase most of the solutions I used are widely available on the internet. For problems that don't have solutions I will attempt provide sketches of solutions.

Since the three angles APB, BPC, and CPA are all equal and sum to 360 they each must have measure 120 degrees. Since angle BAC is 60 degrees, quadrilateral PEAF must be cyclic (since opposite angles sum to 180 degrees). Due to the <a href="https://archive.lib.msu.edu/crcmath/math/math/m/m277.htm">miquel theorem</a>, this implies that point Q lies on line BC. From there it is mostly just computation after a bit of an angle chase to find some similar triangles. I believe the answer to this question is 4007.

Problem 3 involves an interesting approach to proving whether or not a set of conditions can be satisfied with numbers a,b,c,d by considering whether or not there exists a polynomial with roots a,b,c,d.
<br>
Problem 4 involves the use of the incenter excenter lemma along with the converse of power of a point to solve the problem. I personally didn't find it to be a super exciting problem however I couldn't resist putting it here since it was already in the document.
